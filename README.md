# Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft: Galactic Space Craft Control

## Overview
As part of the prestigious ISRO's Chandrayaan 3 mission, this software plays a crucial role in controlling the latest lunar spacecraft, translating commands from Earth into instructions for galactic navigation. Designed for precision and efficiency, this program is the bridge between mission control and the Chandrayaan 3 spacecraft, navigating through the galaxy using a sophisticated coordinate system.

### Galactic Navigation System
- **Coordinates**: The spacecraft operates in a three-dimensional space using galactic coordinates (x, y, z).
- **Directions**: It interprets and executes commands to move forward (`f`), reverse (`r`), up (`u`), back (`b`), and left (`l`).

### Example
- **Starting Point**: (0, 0, 0) with initial direction 'N'.
- **Commands**: `f`, `r`, `u`, `b`, `l`.
- **Final Position**: (0, 1, -1) with final direction 'N'.

## Requirements
To run this program, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Setup and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chandrayaan3-control.git

## Testing

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

python -m unittest tests/test_spaceship.py
