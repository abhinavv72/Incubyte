Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft: Galactic Space Craft Control
Description
As a scientist at ISRO controlling the latest lunar spacecraft Chandrayaan 3, this program translates commands sent from Earth into instructions understood by the spacecraft. The spacecraft navigates through the galaxy using galactic coordinates, represented by x, y, z coordinates.
Example
Given the starting point (0, 0, 0) following (x, y, z) and initial direction 'N', the following commands result in the indicated final position and direction:

Commands: f, r, u, b, l
Starting Position: (0, 0, 0)
Initial Direction: 'N'
Final Position: (0, 1, -1)
Final Direction: 'N'
